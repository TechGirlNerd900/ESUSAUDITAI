# Rules for Context 7
When using Context, make sure that you keep the range of output in the range 2k to 10k based on what you think is the best.
Maintain a file named library.md to stpre the Library IDs that you search for and before searching make sure that you check the file and use the library ID already available. Otherwise, search for it

# . Task: Unify Frontend by Migrating Legacy UI into Next.js Application
Objective:

// broser consoler error
Suggested fix
Ensure that your server-side application has a route or endpoint configured to handle GET requests at the /register path. The specific fix depends on the server-side framework or technology you are using.
Refactor the project to resolve critical architectural conflicts by migrating the standalone React UI from the client directory into the primary nextjs application. The goal is to create a single, modern, and maintainable codebase while preserving the existing user interface design and functionality.

Key Deliverables & Acceptance Criteria:

UI Component Migration:

remove currrent Next.js UI  and start to migrate again from .claude/src to next.js for a reppliacted UI 

All React components from .claude/src/components and .claude/src/pages must be successfully moved and integrated into the nextjs/app directory structure.
The application's visual styling (from .claude/src/styles and .claude/src/index.css) must be consolidated into nextjs/app/globals.css and applied correctly.
The final application must be visually identical to the legacy version.
Modernize Authentication and Data Fetching:
with fetch or direct server-side fetching with the Supabase client.
Codebase Cleanup and Simplification:

Once the migration is complete and verified, the entire client directory must be deleted.
Obsolete root-level files (vite.config.js, test-auth.js, test-production.js) must be removed.
The database migrations must be consolidated into a single, authoritative schema.sql file to ensure database consistency.
Documentation Update:

ansure that all the routes and paths properly added

The README.md and all other documentation must be updated to reflect the unified Next.js architecture, including new setup instructions and API endpoint details.
