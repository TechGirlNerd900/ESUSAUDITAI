### Feature Analysis for EsusAuditAI

This analysis compares your desired feature list with the currently implemented functionalities in the EsusAuditAI application codebase.

### ✅ **Implemented or Partially Implemented Features**

These are the features that have a clear basis in the existing code.

- **7. 📚 Document Intelligence (AI Document Review) - ✅ Implemented**
    
    - **What Exists:** This is a core, working feature of your app. The code shows you can upload documents (`invoices`, `contracts`, `bank statements`), and the backend uses Azure Document Intelligence and a Large Language Model (Gemini/GPT) to extract and analyze the text from these files.
        
- **5. 📌 Risk Identification & Control Evaluation - ✅ Partially Implemented**
    
    - **What Exists:** Your AI analysis pipeline is designed to identify "red flags" and risks from the text of uploaded documents. The database also has a `risk_assessments` table ready.
        
    - **What's Missing:** It doesn't yet automatically generate a full Risk Matrix or evaluate the effectiveness of internal controls from data patterns. The feature currently points out risks from documents rather than performing a deep, structured risk assessment.
        
- **1. 📊 Automated Financial Data Analysis - ✅ Partially Implemented**
    
    - **What Exists:** The application can ingest financial documents and perform a general AI-based analysis to find highlights and red flags.
        
    - **What's Missing:** It does not yet automatically process a full trial balance, map it to a structured financial statement (Assets, Liabilities, etc.), or perform specific calculations like ratio or variance analysis.
        
- **12. 💼 Support for Internal Auditors - ✅ Partially Implemented**
    
    - **What Exists:** The existing document analysis, risk identification, and comprehensive audit logging features are all valuable tools that directly support the work of internal auditors.
        
    - **What's Missing:** There are no features specifically for continuous control monitoring or automated alerts for policy breaches.
