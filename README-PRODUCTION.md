### Feature Analysis for EsusAuditAI

This analysis compares your desired feature list with the currently implemented functionalities in the EsusAuditAI application codebase.

### ✅ **Implemented or Partially Implemented Features**

These are the features that have a clear basis in the existing code.

- **7. 📚 Document Intelligence (AI Document Review) - ✅ Implemented**
    
    - **What Exists:** This is a core, working feature of your app. The code shows you can upload documents (`invoices`, `contracts`, `bank statements`), and the backend uses Azure Document Intelligence and a Large Language Model (Gemini/GPT) to extract and analyze the text from these files.
        
- **5. 📌 Risk Identification & Control Evaluation - ✅ Partially Implemented**
    
    - **What Exists:** Your AI analysis pipeline is designed to identify "red flags" and risks from the text of uploaded documents. The database also has a `risk_assessments` table ready.
        
    - **What's Missing:** It doesn't yet automatically generate a full Risk Matrix or evaluate the effectiveness of internal controls from data patterns. The feature currently points out risks from documents rather than performing a deep, structured risk assessment.
        
- **1. 📊 Automated Financial Data Analysis - ✅ Partially Implemented**
    
    - **What Exists:** The application can ingest financial documents and perform a general AI-based analysis to find highlights and red flags.
        
    - **What's Missing:** It does not yet automatically process a full trial balance, map it to a structured financial statement (Assets, Liabilities, etc.), or perform specific calculations like ratio or variance analysis.
        
- **12. 💼 Support for Internal Auditors - ✅ Partially Implemented**
    
    - **What Exists:** The existing document analysis, risk identification, and comprehensive audit logging features are all valuable tools that directly support the work of internal auditors.
        
    - **What's Missing:** There are no features specifically for continuous control monitoring or automated alerts for policy breaches.
        

### ❌ **Aspirational or Not Yet Implemented Features**

These are features that are planned in your documentation and database schema but for which the application logic has not yet been built.

- **2. 🗂️ Account Classification & Mapping - ❌ Not Implemented**
    
    - The app does not currently map General Ledger accounts to audit categories or IFRS/GAAP codes.
        
- **3. 🔎 Substantive Testing Preparation - ❌ Not Implemented**
    
    - There is no functionality for generating sampling suggestions or automatically preparing detailed working papers.
        
- **4. 📜 Regulatory & Compliance Checks - ❌ Not Implemented**
    
    - The app cannot yet automatically check for compliance against Nigerian standards like FRS, CAMA 2020, or FRCN guidelines.
        
- **6. 🧾 Drafting Audit Reports & Management Letters - ❌ Not Implemented**
    
    - While the database is ready for it, the app cannot yet automatically draft the audit opinion or generate a management letter.
        
- **8. 🧮 Working Paper Generation - ❌ Not Implemented**
    
    - The database tables for workpapers exist, but the application cannot automatically create and fill them out.
        
- **9. 📅 Timeline & Task Automation - ❌ Not Implemented**
    
    - There are no features for managing audit checklists, tracking tasks, or sending reminders.
        
- **10. 📈 Forecasting & Advisory - ❌ Not Implemented**
    
    - The AI's capabilities are currently focused on analyzing historical data, not on forecasting trends or providing advisory insights.
        
- **11. 🤝 Integration with Accounting Software - ❌ Not Implemented**
    
    - The app is document-upload-based and does not currently sync directly with accounting software like Sage, QuickBooks, or Nigerian ERPs.
        
- **Bonus: 🌐 Localization & Nigeria-Specific Features - ❌ Not Implemented**
    
    - There is no specific logic yet for handling Naira currency formatting or Nigerian tax categories (WHT, VAT, CIT).
        

In summary, your application has a strong foundation in
 **AI-powered document intelligence and high-level risk identification**. The next logical steps would be to build out the structured data processing features (like trial balance mapping) and the automated generation of reports and working papers.
