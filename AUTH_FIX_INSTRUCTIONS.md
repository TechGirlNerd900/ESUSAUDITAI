Comprehensive Code Review - Esus Audit AI

1. Authentication & Authorization Issues

Critical Issues:

Inconsistent Supabase Client Usage: The codebase mixes deprecated @supabase/supabase-js with modern @supabase/ssr across different files (lib/database.js, lib/security.js).

Cookie Handling Flaws: The middleware and server client implementations have inconsistent cookie handling patterns that could lead to session corruption and random logouts.

Missing Authorization Controls: Several API routes lack proper authorization checks, potentially allowing users to access or modify resources they shouldn't have access to.

Recommendations:

Standardize on @supabase/ssr across the entire codebase

Implement consistent cookie handling with the setAll() pattern

Add proper RBAC validation to all API endpoints

2. Database Schema Inconsistencies

Critical Issues:

Table Name Confusion: Code references a 'profiles' table while the schema defines a 'users' table

Schema Duplication: The projects table is defined twice in schema.sql (lines 85-98 and 282-294) with different column definitions

Inconsistent Foreign Keys: The second projects table definition uses gen_random_uuid() while the first uses uuid_generate_v4()

Type Inconsistencies: The audit_programs table uses INTEGER for IDs while most other tables use UUID

Recommendations:

Resolve the duplicate projects table definition

Standardize on UUID for all primary keys

Ensure consistent naming between code references and database schema

Fix the user profile trigger in fix-auth-issues.sql

3. Security Vulnerabilities

Critical Issues:

In-Memory Rate Limiting: The rate limiter implementation in rateLimiter.ts uses in-memory storage which won't scale across multiple server instances

Input Validation Gaps: Several API endpoints lack proper input validation

Error Handling Exposing Sensitive Data: Some error responses may leak sensitive information

Recommendations:

Implement Redis-based rate limiting (already configured but not fully implemented)

Add comprehensive input validation to all API endpoints

Standardize error handling to prevent information disclosure

4. Code Duplication and Inconsistencies

Critical Issues:

Duplicate Authentication Logic: Authentication checks are implemented inconsistently across API routes

Inconsistent Response Formats: API routes return different error/success structures

Mixed Database Access Patterns: Some files use direct Supabase queries while others use the Database class

Recommendations:

Use the centralized authenticateApiRequest function consistently

Standardize API response formats

Adopt a consistent database access pattern

5. Incomplete Features and Logic

Critical Issues:

Incomplete Organization Handling: The organization-related code doesn't fully implement the intended functionality

Unfinished User Profile Management: The user profile creation trigger has issues

Incomplete Error Handling: Many API endpoints have basic error handling that doesn't provide useful information to users

Recommendations:

Complete the organization management features

Fix the user profile creation trigger

Implement comprehensive error handling with user-friendly messages

6. Performance Concerns

Critical Issues:

No Connection Pooling: Database connections are not optimized

Large Chat History: No pagination for chat history which could impact performance

Missing Database Indexes: Some frequently queried fields lack indexes

Recommendations:

Implement connection pooling for database access

Add pagination to chat endpoints

Add missing indexes to frequently queried fields

7. Specific File Issues

nextjs/app/api/auth/signup/route.ts:

Uses app_settings table for invitation storage which is not ideal

No validation for password complexity

No transaction wrapping for organization and user creation

nextjs/lib/apiAuth.ts:

The authenticateApiRequest function doesn't handle rate limiting properly

The checkOrganizationAccess function doesn't account for organization hierarchies

nextjs/lib/database.js:

Mixes Supabase client implementations

Lacks proper error handling and retry logic

No connection pooling

nextjs/middleware.ts:

Cookie handling issues that could lead to session corruption

Doesn't properly handle API routes that should be public

8. Immediate Action Plan

Fix Authentication Issues:

Standardize on @supabase/ssr

Fix cookie handling

Implement proper RBAC

Resolve Database Schema Issues:

Fix the duplicate projects table

Ensure consistent naming

Fix the user profile trigger

Enhance Security:

Implement Redis-based rate limiting

Add comprehensive input validation

Standardize error handling

Improve Code Quality:

Remove duplicated code

Standardize response formats

Adopt consistent patterns
